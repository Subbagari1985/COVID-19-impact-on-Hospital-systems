Background
The onset of COVID-19 has adversely affected our lives. As of July 31st 2021 there has been approximately 35 million cases and 620,000 deaths.  Although many studies have indicated that chronic health conditions (i.e., obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes) are related to COVID-19 related deaths, limited data has examined the impact of hospital system factors on COVID-related deaths.

Purpose:

The purpose of this study was to exmine the relationship between hospital-related variables and COVID-19 deaths.  The proposed independent variables for our analysis were number of patients hospitalized and the number of patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).  The dependent variable was COVID-confirmed or COVID-probable death.

Hypotheses:

1. We hypothesize that COVID-19 related hospitalization will be positively and significantly associated with COVID-19 related deaths.
2. COVID-19 related ICU stays will be positively and significantly associated with COVID-19 related deaths
